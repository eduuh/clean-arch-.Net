# Dotnet Core with cleanArchitecture

Using EntityFramework **code first** approach. I found out that using **package versions** that don't match with **thes installed runtime**. Migration generation will fail. The package version to install should be the same as the installed runtimes fro your project.

To check on the installed runtimes you could use the command.

```bash
dotnet --info
```

## Running the project

### Migration. You will need to install dotnet-ef

```bash
➜ dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef
```

To confirm that **dotnet ef tool**  is installed run the command **dotnet ef** alone. The command should output something to confirm its presence.

### Set up path to dotnet tools

This is done by adding this to your **shell** start up shell scripts.

### Running the Project

We need to tell our project where our startup project is. **-p** stated that it is a **project**.

```bash
dotnet run -p Api
```

### Generating  Migrations

Since this is a **clean architecture** project. In order to generate migrations in the code you will need to run the command. Every time you make a change to your Persistence project you will be required to creat a new migations.

```bash
➜ dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate -p Persistence/ -s Api
```

In order to generate migrations you will need to add a package **Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design** to your project. Just refer this package from nuget.

### Creating A database From Migrations

The **dotnet ef** code provides a way to **create or update** a database from the command line.  I don't preffer this approach.

The approach i will use is to **check if the migrations** exists from the **program.cs** file and then **create a database with the migrations**. Later i will add **seeding data** for the database.

### Added SeedData

**DataContext** class is used by entity framework to create database from our models. EntityFramework provides a way to manipulate object that are created from the **datacontext** class. By ovverriding the **OnModelCreating** method. You get access to a **model builder** which can be use to seed data, in this case.

```c#
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder builder){
  builder.Entity<Values>().HasData(
    new Values { Id = 1, Name = "value 101" },
    new Values { Id = 2, Name = "value 102" },
    new Values { Id = 3, Name = "value 103" }
);
}
```

Once you override the method. Rember to **generate migration for the seeddata**.

```bash
dotnet ef migrations add SeedData -p Persistence/ -s Api/
```

Restarting our application will ensure the **migrations are** added to our database.

### When doing Database queries

It is usually advisable to run **asyncronous** queries for our database requests, since the queries could be **long running** and you don't want the code to be blocking. Making it asyncronous, you now are able to run the requests on multiple threads. The database request is passed to a different **thread** and then we await the **task** to be completed.

```csharp
[HttpGet]
public async Task<ActionResult<IEnumerable<Values>>> Get()
{
    var values = await _context.Values.ToListAsync();
    return Ok(values);
}
```

#### Testing Api with Postman

When it comes to testing your api. The browser in usually not the best tool to test your **rest api**. You could just took to using **postman utility** to test your api.
